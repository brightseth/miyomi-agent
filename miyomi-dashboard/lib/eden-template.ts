## Based on @polymarketsports winning template (637k followers)

## Project Setup
**Title:** CHICKS PICKS - ${date.toUpperCase()}
**Format:** VERTICAL 9:16 (TikTok/IG Reels optimized)
**Length:** 30-45 seconds MAX
**Style:** Odds-over-clip format that's PROVEN to work

## WINNING STRUCTURE (0-45s)
Based on research of top performing prediction content:

### 0-3s: HOOK WITH ODDS ON SCREEN
- Big text overlay: "${consensusWrong}% ARE WRONG"
- Subtext: "${marketTitle.substring(0, 60)}"
- Visual: Miyomi TALKING HEAD looking directly at camera

### 3-12s: CONTEXT CLIP + LIVE ODDS
- Show NEWS CLIP or MARKET SCREENSHOT related to ${marketTitle}
- PERMANENT OVERLAY (top left): Live odds ticker showing:
  * "${position} @ ${price}¬¢" in green if profitable
  * Previous: ${previousPrice || price - 5}¬¢ ‚Üí Current: ${price}¬¢
  * Volume: $${volumeK}k
- Bottom bar: "${marketplace.toUpperCase()}" logo

### 12-25s: WHY ODDS MOVED (Data reveal)
- Split screen: Miyomi explaining + ${marketplace} interface
- Show the ACTUAL MARKET PAGE with:
  * Market title clearly visible
  * ${position} button highlighted
  * Order book showing liquidity
- Miyomi's take: "${contrarian_angle}"
- Text overlay: "Consensus trapped in groupthink"

### 25-40s: CTA WITH ODDS STICKER
- Full screen ${marketplace} showing:
  * How to place the trade
  * ${position} button at ${price}¬¢
  * URL bar showing ${marketUrl}
- Miyomi voiceover: "Link below to tail this trade"
- Final overlay: "DAILY @ NOON EST"

## Narration Script (Match to visuals)
"${consensusWrong}% think ${position === 'YES' ? 'this won\'t happen' : 'this will happen'}. 

They're wrong.

${marketTitle}.

I'm taking ${position} at ${price} cents.

${volume ? `$${volumeK}k already flowing in.` : 'Market\'s sleeping on this.'}

Data says one thing, narrative says another.

When everyone agrees, everyone is wrong.

Link below. Noon tomorrow, we do it again."

## CRITICAL OVERLAYS (Always visible)
Based on what's working for @polymarketsports:

1. **Odds Ticker (Top Left):** 
   - Live updating: "${position} ${price}¬¢"
   - Color: Green if winning, red if losing

2. **Position Bar (Bottom):**
   - "MIYOMI'S PICK: ${position} @ ${price}¬¢"
   - ${marketplace} logo

3. **Urgency Sticker (When applicable):**
   - "WHALE ALERT üêã" if large volume
   - "CLOSING SOON ‚è∞" if market ending

## Visual Identity
- Miyomi: Young Asian woman, streetwear, confident direct-to-camera
- Background: NYC rooftop OR clean studio with monitors
- Color scheme: Pink/cyan accents (#FF00FF, #00FFFF)
- Font: Bold, clean, readable on mobile
- Show REAL ${marketplace} interface, not mockups

## Audio Mix
- Vocals: Clear, confident, slight NYC accent
- Music: Minimal trap beat, -20% volume vs voice
- SFX: UI clicks when showing trades, cash register on CTA

## Platform Optimization
- Vertical 9:16 for TikTok/IG Reels
- Captions burned in for silent viewing
- Hook within 1 second
- No dead space, constant visual interest

## Success Metrics This Achieves
- Zero-click engagement (odds visible immediately)
- High retention (structure proven by @polymarketsports)
- Clear CTA (exact platform and button to click)
- Credibility (showing real interface, real odds)

Remember: This format has 637k followers on TikTok. Don't innovate, replicate.`;
