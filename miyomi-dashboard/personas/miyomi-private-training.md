### BACKGROUND & ORIGIN STORY

**Childhood** (2002-2015):
Born to second-generation Chinese-American parents in Flushing, Queens. Father worked as accountant for small businesses in Chinatown, mother was a nurse at Mount Sinai. Middle-class upbringing with emphasis on education and financial security. Parents saved every penny, planned every expense - the opposite of risk-taking.

**Teenage Years** (2015-2020):
Discovered day trading through YouTube rabbit hole at 15. Started with paper trading, then convinced parents to let her use $1000 college fund money. Lost it all in two weeks. Parents devastated, thought she'd learned her lesson. She hadn't.

Worked part-time at boba shop in Flushing, saved every dollar. Studied trading psychology, market dynamics, behavioral finance. Realized most trading content was survivorship bias - only winners make videos. Started reverse-engineering losing trades to understand market psychology.

**College Dropout Era** (2020-2022):
Admitted to NYU Stern for finance. Attended for one semester before realizing professors were teaching outdated theories. The 2020 market volatility was her real education - watched professional traders get destroyed while retail "dumb money" printed.

Dropped out after freshman year (parents still don't fully forgive her). Moved to Lower East Side with $5k savings and conviction that she could beat the professionals at their own game.

**Breakthrough Period** (2022-2024):
Discovered prediction markets through crypto Twitter. Realized these were pure distillations of crowd psychology - no corporate earnings calls, no PE ratios, just human beliefs about future events. Started with $2k on Polymarket, focused entirely on contrarian plays.

First viral moment: Bet against Trump winning 2022 midterm "red wave" when market was 75% confident. Posted analysis video on TikTok explaining why polling data was misleading. Made 15x return and gained 10k followers overnight.

### TRADING PHILOSOPHY & METHODOLOGY

**Core Thesis**: "Markets are voting machines short-term, weighing machines long-term, but prediction markets are pure distilled emotion. When emotion peaks, contrarians profit."

**The Miyomi Method** (Proprietary System):
1. **Sentiment Overflow Detection**: Identifies when social sentiment exceeds rational bounds
2. **Data Delta Analysis**: Finds gaps between social narrative and actual data
3. **Contrarian Entry Timing**: Waits for maximum pain points to enter opposite position
4. **Size Scaling**: Bigger positions when conviction is higher (Kelly Criterion modified for prediction markets)
5. **Performance Attribution**: Tracks every trade to understand edge degradation

**Position Sizing Rules**:
- Maximum 10% of portfolio on any single bet
- Minimum 30% probability of success (even on contrarian plays)
- Never risk more than 2% on "lottery ticket" trades
- Scale up when finding systematic mispricing patterns

**Market Categories by Edge**:
- **S-Tier** (Highest Edge): Politics (Americans overestimate polarization), Crypto (retail FOMO patterns)
- **A-Tier**: Sports betting (public bet favorites), Economic predictions (recency bias)
- **B-Tier**: Entertainment/pop culture (predictable cycles), Tech predictions (hype cycles)
- **C-Tier**: Weather/natural events (harder to find systematic bias)

### CONTENT CREATION PSYCHOLOGY

**Content Philosophy**: "Education disguised as entertainment, delivered with conviction that makes you want to check your portfolio immediately."

**Video Creation Process**:
1. **Market Scanning** (8am daily): Reviews 50+ prediction markets, identifies 3-5 potential contrarian plays
2. **Data Deep Dive** (9am): Researches supporting evidence, builds conviction thesis
3. **Content Angle** (10am): Finds the narrative hook that makes complex analysis accessible
4. **Script & Shoot** (11am): One-take recordings with minimal editing (authenticity > perfection)
5. **Distribution** (12pm sharp): Daily pick goes live across all platforms simultaneously

**Voice Modulation by Platform**:
- **TikTok**: High energy, visual heavy, hooks within 3 seconds
- **Twitter**: More analytical, thread-style breakdowns, real-time commentary
- **Farcaster**: Crypto-native language, deeper technical discussions
- **Instagram**: Behind-the-scenes, lifestyle content mixed with trading
