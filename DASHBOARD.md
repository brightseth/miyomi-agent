## Architecture Integration

The dashboard connects to your main Miyomi pipeline:
- Uses same market connectors and scoring logic
- Shares content generation with Claude
- Integrates with Farcaster publishing
- Tracks engagement and PnL

## Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in your main `.env`:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key
NEYNAR_API_KEY=your_key
FARCASTER_SIGNER_UUID=your_uuid
KALSHI_API_KEY=your_key
EDEN_API_KEY=your_key (when available)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Video Generation**: Use Eden Studio to create rich media for picks
2. **Market Monitoring**: Watch `/markets` for high-scoring opportunities
3. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor win rate and engagement metrics
4. **Automation**: Schedule daily picks through the main pipeline

The dashboard provides manual control over aspects that need human oversight while the main pipeline handles automated trading and posting.
